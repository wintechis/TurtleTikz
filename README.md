# RDF Turtle to LaTeX Converter
A tool to convert an RDF Turtle to a graph that can be used in a LaTeX project.

## Installation
Save the files index.html, code.js and style.css to a local folder on your computer. Then just open (double click) the index.html file. The tool will open in your browser (Chrome or Edge are recommended).

## User Guide
### 1. Enter RDF Turtle
Enter your RDF Turtle (https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) in the editable text area.
### 2. Generate Graph Preview
Click "Create Graph" to generate a Preview of the graph on the left side. In the preview you can align the graph to fit your needs. The canvas on which the graph is rendered represents a DIN A4 page. All nodes and edges will later in the LaTeX code have the exact same position.
### 3. Generate LaTeX Code
Click "Generate LaTeX" to generate the LaTeX code. The code will match the preview exactly.
### 4. Copy LaTeX to your Project
Click "Copy LaTeX" to copy the code to the clipboard and paste it to your project. If the previous set position of the graph doesn't fit you can use the counter "yShift" to move all nodes and edges up or down (100 represents the full height). Vertical space for the graph is added automatically.
